# cse237-project
Our project is a program that allows users to enter/track their weekly caloric intake and activity goal. After this, the user can then enter their daily progress and compare that to the goals they have set for themselves. 

For this iteration, we have completed several user stories. Mainly cleaning up all our JUnit Tests. We added a unit test for clearing goals for our users and then seperated all our tests into seperate classes per Professor Shook's feedback. We then merged our development branch into Master!

Our program runs smoothly in eclipse though we are having some issues when running our bash script that we were unable to solve! 

To compile and then run our code from the command line, the javac and java commands need to be run on src/MainMenu/MainMenu.java

Good Stuff so far! We all loved working on this project.
