# cse237-project
Our project is a program that allows users to enter/track their weekly caloric intake and activity goal. After this, the user can then enter their daily progress and compare that to the goals they have set for themselves. 

For this iteration, we have completed several user stories. The first set of user stories that were completed was creating a MainMenu for our program and then subsequent menus for new and existing users to our program. After this the user stories that were completed were creating a UserData class that would persist and load data for our existing program users. This was the most challenging story at this point. 

For the next iteration we intend to complete the user stories that allow users to compare their current activity/caloric intake goals to their weekly desired goals. We also need to implement unit tests on our program. We will probably also implement several other user stories based on the functionality of our submission for the first iteration. 

As of now, there is nothing that we are aware of that doesnt work in our program. 

To compile and then run our code from the command line, the javac and java commands need to be run on src/MainMenu/MainMenu.java

Good Stuff so far!
