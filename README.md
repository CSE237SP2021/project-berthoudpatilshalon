# cse237-project
Our project is a program that allows users to enter/track their weekly caloric intake and activity goal. After this, the user can then enter their daily progress and compare that to the goals they have set for themselves. 

For this iteration, we have completed several user stories. We now can allow users to enter their caloric or activity goal for a week and then enter their daily progress. On top of this, the program lets the user know how they are doing daily in terms of progressing towards that goal. We also updated our functions were calling upon one another as users inputed data. This reduced the lines of code needed as well as clean our code substantially. We also added unit tests for adding calorie/activity goals as well as daily amounts.

For our next iteration, we need to work on our unit testing and making sure our tests work smoothly. We also need to clean our bash script as currently there is an error somewhere! As of now we don't have any other user stories we want to add but maybe you will have some suggestions for us! 

As of now, there is nothing that we are aware of that doesnt work in our program. 

To compile and then run our code from the command line, the javac and java commands need to be run on src/MainMenu/MainMenu.java

Good Stuff so far!
